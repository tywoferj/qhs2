# Images

Place your images here so they load correctly:

## Hero slider (homepage)

- **hero-slide-1.png** – Slide 1: Diverse medical team (doctors and nurses in hospital hallway). Add your image here.
- **hero-slide-2.png** – Slide 2: Modern clinic interior (reception desk, waiting area). Add your image here.
- Slide 3 uses a built-in modern clinic image (no file needed).

If hero-slide-1 or hero-slide-2 are missing, the slider will show a fallback image for that slide.

## Other

- **blog-accreditation.jpg** – Blog card (recommended: 600×375 or similar 16:10)
- **blog-management.jpg** – Blog card
- **blog-revenue.jpg** – Blog card

Use JPG or WebP for photos. Next.js will optimize and serve AVIF/WebP when supported.
